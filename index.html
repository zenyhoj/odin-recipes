        These simple skillet dinners feature seasonal spring vegetables that are
        widely available from March through Mayâ€”think the bright, fresh flavors
        of asparagus, artichokes, fennel, and peas. They prove that you can coax
        a lot of flavor out of simple, affordable ingredients. Pair your spring
        produce with chicken, beef, turkey, beans, or shrimp, and in less than
        an hour you'll have a complete dinner on the table. And with these
        one-pan meals, you'll cut down on clean-up duty, so you can spend more
        time enjoying the beautiful seasonal weather.
