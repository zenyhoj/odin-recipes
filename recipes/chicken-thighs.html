      <h1>Skillet Chicken Thighs with Carrots and Potatoes</h1>
      <img src="./assets/images/chicken-thighs.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        This quick, family-friendly stovetop recipe is almost entirely
        hands-off. Chicken thighs simmer with baby carrots, baby potatoes, and
        onions in a chicken stock-based sauce in this one-skillet chicken thigh
        dinner. A spoonful of cornstarch makes the sauce taste remarkably silky.

      <div class="ingredients">
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound bone-in chicken thighs</li>

          <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>

          <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or more to taste</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>

          <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

          <li>¾ pound baby carrots</li>

          <li>½ pound baby potatoes, halved</li>
          <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
          <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
          <span class="step-span">Step 1</span>Season chicken thighs with
          paprika, salt, and pepper.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="step-span">Step 2</span>Heat oil in a skillet over
          medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs skin-side down in the skillet
          and cook, without moving, until golden brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Flip
          thighs over and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the
          skillet and set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step-span">Step 3</span> Add potatoes, cut side down, and
          cook over medium-high heat until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add
          carrots and onions and cook until onions are soft and translucent, 8
          to 10 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup chicken broth, scraping up all the
          browned bits.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="step-span">Step 4</span> Dissolve corn starch in 1/4 cup
          chicken broth and pour into the skillet. Stir until well combined.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="step-span">Step 5</span> Place chicken thighs over
          vegetables, cover, and cook until carrots are tender and chicken is no
          longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An
          instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165
          degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with additional salt and pepper if
          needed.
