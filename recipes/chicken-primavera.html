      <h1>Easy Skillet Chicken Primavera</h1>
      <img src="./assets/images/chicken-primavera.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        With a mix of fresh and frozen vegetables, this chicken dinner is
        super-affordable and customizable. Dig into your spice cabinet to season
        the chicken breasts with dried parsley and basil, then add frozen mixed
        veggies and fresh grape tomatoes, green onions, and zucchini. A scoop of
        sun-dried tomato pesto ties everything together, and you can enjoy the
        protein and produce mix as a one-pot pasta, over rice, or alongside
        mashed potatoes.
